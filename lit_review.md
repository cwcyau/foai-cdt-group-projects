# Milestone 1: Literature Review

## Overall Objective 

The objective of Milestone 1 is to ensure that each
project group develops a comprehensive understanding of the theoretical
background, existing research, and current methodologies relevant to
their project topic. The literature review should demonstrate the team's
ability to critically analyse academic sources, identify knowledge gaps,
and establish a conceptual foundation that supports the direction and
significance of the project.

## Requirements

- Each group must compile a single, coherent report summarising their
literature review.

- The report should provide a clear, relevant, and logically structured
perspective on the topic covered by the project.

- The contributions of each group member must be clearly identified within
the report.

- Each team member is expected to contribute at least 1200 words.

- Each individual contribution must include one or more original conceptual diagrams or figures that illustrate the concepts or methods
discussed.

- The final report must not exceed 2000 × \[number of team members\] words.

Reports should be submitted on Canvas. Each member of the group should
submit a copy of the group report (this enables us to provide an
individual grading).
