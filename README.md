# FoAI CDT Group Projects

This is a repository for Fundamentals of AI CDT Group Projects

## General Information



## Expected Deliverables

Each group will be expected to fulfil the requirements of three project milestones:

|Milestone|Approximate Timing (a)|Deliverable (b)|
|---------|------------------|-----------|
|1|Start of Hilary|Literature Review|
|2|End of Hilary|Project Progress Report|
|3|End of Summer|Project Presentation and Final Report|

(a) Exact timings may vary in each academic year

(b) Requirements may vary depending on the nature of the project

**Literature review**: The first milestone will typically involve some form of literature review. You will be informed about relevant literature by your project mentors.

**Project progress project**: The next milestone will be expected to contain a report of the findings of the project. This will include documentation regarding the methods, implementations and investigations conducted. You may also be expected to produce documented software and reproducible code for your work.

**Final project presentation**: For the final milesone, you will be expected to produce an oral presentation describing your work. You will also be asked to update your progress report into a final report. 

Detailed requirements for milestone deliverables will be provided in advance of the deadlines by the CDT.

## Assessment 

Each milestone deliverable will be considered a unit of assessment. 

All reports and presentations will be assessed by the CDT and scored as either **Satisfactory** or **Unsatisfactory**. 

Groups who demonstrate that they have engaged with the project requirements, shown consistent effort and provided output consistent with the requirements would meet the requirement for a positive grade. 

Example behaviours which might lead to an unsatisfactory grade includes: 

- unexplained absence from project work periods,
- 
- failure to provide deliverables by the required deadlines.

Each group member is also required to complete a personal self-assessment review. This is not graded but is used by the CDT to record your learning and to support the Directors in monitoring your progress and development.

Note that deliverables will not be associated with the implementation or delivery of novel research ideas. Groups are welcome and encouraged to progress to this stage if possible. However, it is important that groups do not rush to produce novel work without rigorous investigation of existing methods and techniques. Group projects are first and foremost a learning opportunity.

## Support Structures 

Each group will be supported by a University project mentor, who will normally be a permanent academic member of staff, who you should expect to meet at least once every two weeks during the main project periods.

In addition, projects maybe supported by:

- a University research mentor(s): these are likely to be postdoctoral research staff with expertise in some or all aspects of the project

- a University Research Software Engineer: to support with any software development aspects of your project

- a EIT project mentor: for projects in collaboration with EIT, a member of EIT research staff who will work alongside the University project mentor in overseeing the project
 
- a EIT research mentor(s):for projects in collaboration with EIT, additional members of EIT research staff who will support the project
